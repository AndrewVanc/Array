# String Sorting Program

This Java program takes a user-defined number of strings as input, sorts the strings in alphabetical order, and then prints the sorted list.

## How It Works

1. The user specifies how many strings they would like to sort.
2. The program collects each string input.
3. The strings are sorted using Java's built-in `Arrays.sort()` method, which arranges them in alphbetical order.
4. The sorted strings are displayed as output.

## Requirements

- Java 8 or higher
- A terminal or command prompt for running the program

## Usage

To compile the program, navigate to the directory containing the `main.java` file.
