# Integer Sorting Program

This Java program takes a user-defined number of integers as input, sorts the integers in ascending order, and then prints the sorted list. The sorting is performed using the built-in `Arrays.sort()` method from the Java standard library.

## How It Works

1. The user is prompted to enter the number of integers to sort.
2. The program accepts integer inputs and stores them in an array.
3. The `sortIntegers` method sorts the array in ascending order using `Arrays.sort()`.
4. The sorted array is printed to the console.

## Requirements

- Java 8 or higher
- A terminal or command prompt to run the program

## Usage

To compile the program, navigate to the directory containing the `Main.java` file and run:
